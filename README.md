# Poker Transformer
Source code for the [Dissecting Transformer](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/552519149) series.

This repository contains a Python notebook that accompanies the poker hand classification experiments
in the series. In addition to defining, training and evaluating the Transformer-based model, it also
contains manually designed neural network parameters that mimics a rule-based algorithm to accomplish
the poker hand classification task.
